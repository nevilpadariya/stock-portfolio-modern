   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Runtime: `Python 3`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Connecting Frontend to Backend

Once both are deployed:

1. Copy your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://stock-portfolio-backend.onrender.com`)
2. Go to your Vercel project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add or update `REACT_APP_API_URL` with your backend URL

## Testing Your Deployed App

1. Access your frontend URL (provided by Vercel)
2. Try to fetch investment strategies and create a portfolio
3. If it works, congratulations! Your app is deployed ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors**: The backend is configured to accept requests from any origin in production mode
- **API Issues**: Make sure you've added your API key to Render environment variables
- **Deployment Failures**: Check build logs in Render/Vercel for specific error messages
